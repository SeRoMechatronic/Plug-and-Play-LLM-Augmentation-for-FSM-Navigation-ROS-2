# Plug-and-Play-LLM-Augmentation-for-FSM-Navigation-ROS-2-
This repository contains the code and data for the paper on 50 Hz FSM navigation augmented with suggestions from an LLM (without fine-tuning), validated under kinematic limits and with deterministic fallback &lt; 5 ms. It includes three ROS 2 nodes (FSM, LLM, Validator/Fusion), CSV datasets, and statistical analysis scripts.
